// When dealing with higher-resolution devices, you might need to use a coordinate system
// that enables you to specify points as floating-point values instead of as simple integers
// (iOS uses a structure called CGRect for working with rectangles. All coordinates and sizes
// are expressed as floating point numbers when working with such rectangles).
// Modify the XYPoint and Rectangle classes from this chapter to deal with floating-point
// numbers.The rectangleâ€™s width, height, area, and perimeter should all work with floating-point numbers as well.

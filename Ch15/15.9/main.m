// Define three new classes, called Song, PlayList, and MusicCollection.
// A Song object will contain information about a particular song, such as its title, artist, album, and playing time.
// A PlayList object will contain the name of the playlist and a collection of songs.
// A MusicCollection object will contain a collection of playlists, including a special master playlist called library that contains every song in the collection. Define these three classes and write methods to do the following:
// Create a Song object and set its information.
// Create a Playlist object, and add songs to and remove songs from a playlist. A new song should be added to the master playlist if itâ€™s not already there. Make sure that if a song is removed from the master playlist, it is removed from all playlists in the music collection as well.
// Create a MusicCollection object, and add playlists to and remove playlists from the collection.
// Search and display the information about any song, any playlist, or the entire music collection.
// Make sure all your classes do not leak memory!

// Program to generate a table of prime numbers
// Program 6.10 has several inefficiencies. One inefficiency results from checking even numbers. 
// Because any even number greater than 2 obviously cannot be prime, the program could simply skip 
// all even numbers as possible primes and as possible divi- sors.The inner for loop is also inefficient 
// because the value of p is always divided by all values of d from 2 through pâ€“1.You can avoid this 
// inefficiency if you add a test for the value of isPrime in the conditions of the for loop. In this manner, 
// you can set up the for loop to continue as long as no divisor is found and the value of d is less than p. 
// Modify Program 6.10 to incorporate these two changes; then run the program to verify its operation.
